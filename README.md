### Task 3: Website Layout Diagrams

For this task, I created three different website layout diagrams to understand common layout structures used in web design.

1. Single-Column Layout

In this layout, all sections (Header, Navigation, Content, Footer) are arranged vertically in one column.
This layout is commonly used for mobile devices because it improves readability and scrolling experience.

2. Two-Column Layout

In this layout, the header and footer remain full width, while the middle section is divided into two parts:

Sidebar (for additional links or information)

Main Content (for primary information)

This layout is commonly used on desktop websites.

3. Three-Column Layout

In this layout, the header and footer remain the same, while the middle section is divided into:

Left Sidebar

Main Content

Right Sidebar

The main content area is wider than the sidebars because it contains the most important information.
